         <div class="information introduction">
             <p>The military of the Ottoman Empire was the backbone of its rise, expansion, and endurance for over six centuries. From the disciplined Janissaries to the swift sipahi cavalry and formidable naval fleets, Ottoman forces combined traditional warrior culture with innovative tactics and technology. Recruitment systems like the devşirme “blood tax” and the timar land-grant program ensured a steady supply of trained soldiers, while logistics networks sustained campaigns from the Balkans to the Arabian deserts. The empire’s armies mastered siegecraft, adopted gunpowder weapons early, and controlled key trade routes through naval dominance in the Mediterranean and beyond. Yet, the military was not static—its history is marked by both groundbreaking reforms and periods of decline, as changing warfare and internal politics challenged its effectiveness. The Ottoman armed forces were more than a fighting machine; they were a complex institution that shaped politics, society, and the very identity of the empire.</p>
