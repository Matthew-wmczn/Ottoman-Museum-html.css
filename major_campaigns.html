         <div class="information introduction">
             <p>The history of the Ottoman Empire is inseparable from its military campaigns, which shaped its borders, power, and legacy over more than six centuries. From its early days as a small Anatolian beylik, the empire expanded through decisive battles and strategic sieges, forging a realm that spanned Europe, Asia, and Africa. Victories such as Varna, Constantinople, and Mohács cemented Ottoman dominance, while campaigns at Vienna and Lepanto tested the limits of its reach. These conflicts were more than clashes of armies—they were turning points that influenced trade, religion, diplomacy, and the fate of entire regions. The Ottoman military adapted across eras, from the horse-archer tactics of the 14th century to the gunpowder sieges of the 15th, the naval dominance of the 16th, and the trench warfare of the 20th. Yet alongside triumph came defeat, reform, and eventual dissolution. Each campaign tells a story of ambition, resilience, and transformation, charting the rise, peak, and fall of one of history’s most enduring empires.</p>
