         <div class="information introduction">
             <p>Rising from a small Anatolian beylik founded by Osman I in 1299, the Ottoman Empire evolved into a vast intercontinental power spanning Europe, Asia, and Africa. Its defining triumph came in 1453 when Mehmed the Conqueror captured Constantinople, transforming the Byzantine capital into Istanbul – a dazzling hub of Islamic art and architecture. Under Süleyman the Magnificent (1520–1566), the empire reached its zenith: architects like Mimar Sinan redefined skylines with masterpieces like the Süleymaniye Mosque, while workshops from Iznik to Baghdad produced luminous ceramics and calligraphy that blended Persian, Arab, and Turkic traditions.</p>
             <p>Yet after 1683, military defeats and internal struggles triggered decline. Reforms like the Tanzimat (1839–1876) modernized institutions but couldn’t halt fragmentation. Following WWI defeat, the empire dissolved in 1922–1923, giving birth to modern Turkey. For over 600 years, it shaped global politics, trade, and culture – leaving behind minaret-studded horizons, illuminated Qurans, and a legacy of synthesis where Byzantine domes met Ottoman tiles in timeless harmony.</p>
